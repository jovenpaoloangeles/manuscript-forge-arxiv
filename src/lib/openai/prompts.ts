Provide your feedback in a structured JSON format. The root object should have the following keys: "overallScore" (1-10), "argumentStrength", "flowAndCohesion", and "terminologyConsistency".

- For "argumentStrength": Provide feedback on how well the paper's central thesis is introduced, supported by evidence, and concluded. Note any logical gaps.
- For "flowAndCohesion": Analyze the transitions between major sections (e.g., from Introduction to Methodology). Are they smooth or abrupt? Are the sections well-linked?
- For "terminologyConsistency": Identify up to 5 key technical terms used in the paper. For each term, state whether it was used consistently. If not, provide examples of inconsistent usage.
- For each key, provide a "score" (1-10), "feedback" (a summary paragraph), "strengths" (an array of strings), and "suggestions" (an array of strings).

Return only valid JSON without any markdown formatting or code blocks.`;
